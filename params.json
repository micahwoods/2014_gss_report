{"name":"2014 gss report","tagline":"The files in this repository generate the 2014 Global Soil Survey report.","body":"The files in this repository will generate the 2014 [Global Soil Survey](http://www.paceturf.org/journal/global_soil_survey) report, a joint project of [PACE Turf](http://www.paceturf.org/), the [Asian Turfgrass Center](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/), and the turfgrass managers from around the world who have contributed samples to this project. \r\n\r\n### Required files and software\r\n\r\nPut these files in a directory. \r\n\r\nOne must have `R` and `LaTeX` installed. The `R` packages `knitr`, `dplyr`, `VGAM`, and `xtable` must be installed also.\r\n\r\nNote that this report uses the tufte-handout class, which is available here: https://code.google.com/p/tufte-latex/. The `tufte-common.def` and `tufte-handout.cls` files should be in the same directory with the `.Rnw` and `.tex` files.\r\n\r\n### Generating the report\r\n\r\nIn `R`:\r\n\r\n`setwd(\"directory name\")`   \r\n`library(knitr)`   \r\n`knit(\"2014_gss_report.Rnw\")`   \r\n\r\nThat will create the `2014_gss_report.tex` file.\r\n\r\nThen at the terminal command line:\r\n\r\n`cd directory name`   \r\n`pdflatex 2014_gss_report.tex`   \r\n\r\nRun `pdflatex 2014_gss_report.tex` a second time to get all the cross-references numbered correctly.\r\n\r\nThat will produce the final report in PDF format. The report is available for download at http://www.paceturf.org/PTRI/Documents/2014_gss_report.pdf\r\n\r\n### The GSS data\r\n\r\nIf you just want to work with the first year data from the Global Soil Survey, those data are in the `/data` folder: https://github.com/micahwoods/2014_gss_report/blob/master/data/20140910_gss.csv","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
